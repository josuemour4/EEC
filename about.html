<h3>About Me</h3>
  

  <p>On <strong>August 20, 2022</strong>, I took a significant step in my journey: I applied for permanent residency in Australia. From the beginning, my goal <strong>was never to stay here forever</strong>, but rather to build a path with fewer obstacles — a journey of personal and professional growth.</p>

  <p>The plan was clear: once my visa was granted, I would dedicate one year to improving my English, and then I would pursue my long-held dream of studying <strong>Engineering</strong>.</p>

  <h2>An Unexpected Turn</h2>

  <p>Unfortunately, things did not go as planned. About <strong>a year after applying</strong>, I was informed that <strong>my visa would not be approved</strong>. The reason: the company sponsoring me <strong>was no longer active</strong>.</p>

  <p>This came as a shock. I had been hired by a company called <strong>Solo 7</strong>, and one of their administrative contacts, <strong>Lachlan Miller</strong>, regularly communicated with me, assigning jobs and requesting service-related documents. Everything seemed legitimate and in order.</p>

  <p>Since I withdrew my residency application, <strong>my life has turned upside down</strong>. Every day has been a psychological and emotional challenge.</p>

  <h2>Why I Created This Space</h2>

  <p>This blog has <strong>two main purposes</strong>:</p>

  <h3>1. Psychological Support</h3>
  <p>After almost 8 years away from my family and friends, seeing a personal project change so drastically, and losing much of the money I had saved with great effort — all of this has taken a serious toll on my mental health.</p>

  <p>Sharing my story here helps me process everything, reflect, and maybe even support others going through similar challenges. Also, my daily work life is, to say the least, quite eventful — and sometimes worth documenting.</p>

  <h3>2. A Commitment to My Dream</h3>
  <p>More than a professional goal, pursuing a degree in <strong>Engineering</strong> is a deeply personal dream. I want to use this space to document my learning path and progress along the way.</p>

  <h2>My Daily Routine</h2>

  <p>My routine is extremely busy, so new content may be added slowly — but consistently.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>My day starts at <strong>4:00 AM</strong>.</li>
    <li>I aim to study at least <strong>1 hour a day</strong> — any extra time is a bonus.</li>
    <li>I leave the house at <strong>6:00 AM</strong> and return around <strong>5:00 PM</strong>.</li>
    <li>Once home, I take a quick shower, drive my wife to work, and spend the rest of the evening with my daughter.</li>
    <li>By <strong>9:30 PM</strong>, it's time to sleep and repeat the routine the next day.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>On weekends, I usually have more time to study. However, getting up on Saturdays is not easy — especially because on Friday I have online therapy sessions around <strong>11:00 PM</strong>, which makes waking up on Sunday even harder.</p>

  <p>If you made it this far, thank you for reading. This space is my outlet, my study notebook, and — above all — a way to keep believing that it’s possible to move forward, even when life takes an unexpected turn.</p>
